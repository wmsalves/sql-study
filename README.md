# SQL Database Studies

This repository contains my studies and experiments related to SQL databases. Currently, I am focused on MySQL, but I plan to explore other relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others in the future.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to understand the core concepts of SQL databases, starting with MySQL, and gradually learning about other relational databases. I aim to explore their architectures, features, practical use cases, and compare them with NoSQL databases.

## Current Focus: MySQL

At this stage, the primary focus is on MySQL, a widely used relational database. I am studying:

- **MySQL setup and configuration**
- **Relational data modeling**
- **Advanced SQL queries (joins, subqueries, etc.)**
- **Indexes and performance optimization**
- **Aggregation functions and grouping**
- **Real-world use cases**

## Structure

The repository includes:

- **MySQL Examples**: SQL queries and use cases.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Problems solved using MySQL.
- **Future Additions**: Upcoming studies on other relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.).

## How to Run

To get started with MySQL examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-study.git
   cd sql-study
